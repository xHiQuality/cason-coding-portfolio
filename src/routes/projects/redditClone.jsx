                Me and four other students were assigned a semester long project where we chose to create a Reddit&#174;&#65039; clone.
                Through using a framework of: React.js,Node.js, and MySQL, we created a CRUD application that simulates (to the best of our ability, and time constraints) the actual product.
                Users can sign up, edit their profile, post, comment, upvote, etc. I was personally responsible for setting up the backend as well as the database.
                I created various methods for contacting the database and tested them using Postman, this was my most complicated yet exciting group project I have faced.
                </p>
                <h4>Node.js Backend</h4>
                <p>
                Becuase of the scope of this project, we used a local database. Because of this, I was able to provide a file that has the database model and update the backend accordingly to
                my peers requests, I split the code up into: routes,controllers, and models. This made readability easier and insured easy editing and
                engineering later.
